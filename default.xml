<!-- TWRP lives in omnirom android-9.0 (not AOSP!) -->
    <project path="bootable/recovery" name="android_bootable_recovery" remote="omnirom" revision="android-9.0" />

<!-- The following directories are actually needed from android_frameworks_base (for FBE decryption)
     * frameworks/base/core/java   (~46MB)
     * frameworks/base/keystore/java  (<1MB)
     And for TWRP
     * frameworks/base/libs/services  (<1MB)
     not only is it not worth syncing a 1GB repo for ~47MB for me, the added dependencies make
     the minimal manifest unworkable.
     So for those that do want to sync frameworks/base but don't want the build to break (eg framworks/support),
     sync it to the staging are and only link the needed directories.
